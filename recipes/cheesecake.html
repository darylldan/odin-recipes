      <p>
        The taste of a Nanaimo bar in a cheesecake! Can't get any better than this. Make in the jelly roll pan for serving a larger crowd. Result is thinner but still as tasty. (You will need to adjust baking time if you use the bigger pan.) Good for 16 servings.

    <h3>🛒 Recipe:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2 1/2 cups</strong> crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREO Cookies)</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> butter, melted</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> chopped pecans</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> flaked coconut</li>
      <li><strong>4 (8 ounce) packages</strong> cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li><strong>1 cup</strong> white sugar</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> custard powder (such as Bird's Custard Powder)</li>
      <li><strong>4</strong> eggs</li>
      <li><strong>6 (1 ounce) squares</strong> semisweet chocolate</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>📜 Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><p>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a bowl until the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and refrigerate while making filling.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating each until fully incorporated before adding the next. Layer the filling over the crust.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40 minutes. Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.
      </p></li>
      <li><p>
        Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the cream, and stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the chocolate mixture over the cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the middle layer, and refrigerate until the topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cold. Store leftovers in refrigerator.
      </p></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>🍴 Enjoy your meal!</h3>
